<h1>Implementing IT Risk Management Using COBIT - Healthcare Sector</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

I implemented an IT risk management program for a healthcare provider using the COBIT framework. I identified critical assets such as EHR systems, PHI databases, and medical devices, conducted a structured risk assessment, and built a COBIT aligned risk register and treatment plan. My recommendations including MFA, network segmentation, SIEM deployment, and HIPAA focused governance controls were adopted into a 12 month roadmap. Outcomes included stronger regulatory compliance, a risk aware culture, and improved resilience against ransomware and insider threats.


<h2>Description</h2>

Using the COBIT framework (APO12 – Manage Risk), I identified critical IT assets including EHR systems, PHI databases, and networked medical devices—through interviews, system reviews, and data flow analysis.

I conducted a structured risk assessment, mapping cyber threats such as ransomware, insider misuse, and third-party misconfigurations against likelihood and impact. A COBIT aligned Cybersecurity Risk Register was developed, supported by a tailored Risk Treatment Plan. Recommendations included MFA for privileged access, network segmentation for medical devices, SIEM deployment, incident response playbooks, and HIPAA aligned governance controls.

To ensure adoption, I created a dual-layer presentation: a board level strategy overview and a technical roadmap for IT and clinical teams. This secured leadership buy-in and operational clarity on risk ownership.

<h2>Outcome</h2>

- 12-month roadmap approved for cybersecurity and governance improvements.

- Stronger HIPAA/HITECH compliance posture achieved ahead of audit cycles.

- Promoted a risk-aware culture across leadership and clinical operations.

- Enhanced resilience through integrated monitoring, backup, and response processes.
