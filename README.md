<h1>Implementing IT Risk Management in a Healthcare Organization</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

I implemented an IT risk management program for a healthcare provider using the COBIT framework. I identified critical assets such as EHR systems, PHI databases, and medical devices, through interviews, system reviews, and data flow analysis. I then conducted a structured risk assessment, mapping threats such as ransomware, insider misuse, and third-party misconfigurations against likelihood and impact.

<h2>Description</h2>

To support decision-making, I developed a COBIT-aligned Cybersecurity Risk Register and a tailored Risk Treatment Plan. My recommendations included MFA for privileged access, network segmentation for medical devices, SIEM deployment, incident response playbooks, and HIPAA-focused governance controls.

To secure adoption, I delivered a dual-layer presentation: a strategic overview for the board and a technical roadmap for IT and clinical teams. This approach clarified risk ownership and ensured alignment between leadership and operations.

<h2>Outcome</h2>

- 12-month roadmap approved for cybersecurity and governance improvements.

- Stronger HIPAA/HITECH compliance posture achieved ahead of audit cycles.

- Promoted a risk-aware culture across leadership and clinical operations.

- Enhanced resilience through integrated monitoring, backup, and response processes.
